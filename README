Social Blocks Version 1.0

Installation:

1.  Place this folder in the yourmoodle/course/format directory.
2.  Add the new block regions to the current theme. (The theme will still work fine with othercourse formats.)

    2.2   Locate the course array: the line containing 'course' => array(
    2.3   Within the course array, locate 'regions' => array(
          The contents of this array may vary, but probably inclide 'side-post' and 'side-pre'.
    2.4   Add 'top1', 'top2', 'top3', 'top4', 'bot1', 'bot2', 'bot3', 'bot4' to the array.
          The line should look somewhat like this(may vary by theme):
                'regions' => array('side-post', 'top1', 'top2', 'top3', 'top4', 'bot1', 'bot2', 'bot3', 'bot4'),
    2.5   Save the file.
